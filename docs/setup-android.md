  - [Expo Integration](#expo-integration)

In order to integrate CodePush into your Android project, please perform the following steps:

### Plugin Installation and Configuration for React Native 0.76 version and above (Android)


1. In your `android/app/build.gradle` file, add the `codepush.gradle` file as an additional build task definition to the end of the file:

    ```gradle
    ...
    apply from: "../../node_modules/@deploypulseio/react-native-code-push/android/codepush.gradle"
    ...
    ```

2. Update the `MainApplication` file to use CodePush via the following changes:

    For React Native 0.76 to 0.81: update the `MainApplication.kt`

    **Important! : PackageList must be instantiated only one in application lifetime.** 

    ```kotlin
    ...
    // 1. Import the plugin class.
    import com.microsoft.codepush.react.CodePush

    class MainApplication : Application(), ReactApplication {
       override val reactNativeHost: ReactNativeHost =
           object : DefaultReactNativeHost(this) {
               override fun getPackages(): List<ReactPackage> = PackageList(this).packages.apply {
                 // Packages that cannot be autolinked yet can be added manually here, for example:
                 // add(MyReactNativePackage())
                }

               // 2. Override the getJSBundleFile method in order to let
               // the CodePush runtime determine where to get the JS
               // bundle location from on each app start
               override fun getJSBundleFile(): String {
                 return CodePush.getJSBundleFile() 
               }
        };
    }

    For React Native 0.82 and above: update the `MainApplication.kt` as follows:

    ```kotlin
    ...
    // 1. Import the plugin class.
    import com.microsoft.codepush.react.CodePush

    class MainApplication : Application(), ReactApplication {

        override val reactHost: ReactHost by lazy {
            getDefaultReactHost(
            context = applicationContext,
            packageList =
                PackageList(this).packages.apply {
                // Packages that cannot be autolinked yet can be added manually here, for example:
                // add(MyReactNativePackage())
                },
            // 2. RN 0.82+ uses ReactHost config instead of overriding getJSBundleFile().
            // Set jsBundleFilePath to CodePush so CodePush resolves the JS bundle path
            // at startup (OTA update if available, fallback to bundled JS otherwise).
            jsBundleFilePath = CodePush.getJSBundleFile(),
            )
        }
    }
    ```


3. Add the Deployment key to `strings.xml`:

   To let the CodePush runtime know which deployment it should query for updates, open your app's `strings.xml` file and add a new string named `CodePushDeploymentKey`, whose value is the key of the deployment you want to configure this app against (like the key for the `Staging` deployment for the `FooBar` app). You can retrieve this value by running `dpctl deployment list <AppName>` and copying the value of the `Key` column which corresponds to the deployment you want to use (see below). Note that using the deployment's name (like Staging) will not work. The "friendly name" is intended only for authenticated management usage from the CLI, and not for public consumption within your app.

   ![Deployment list](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/116461/11601733/13011d5e-9a8a-11e5-9ce2-b100498ffb34.png)

   In order to effectively make use of the `Staging` and `Production` deployments that were created along with your CodePush app, refer to the [multi-deployment testing](../README.md#multi-deployment-testing) docs below before actually moving your app's usage of CodePush into production.

   Your `strings.xml` should looks like this:

   ```xml
    <resources>
        <string name="app_name">AppName</string>
        <string moduleConfig="true" name="CodePushDeploymentKey">DeploymentKey</string>
    </resources>
    ```

    *Note: If you need to dynamically use a different deployment, you can also override your deployment key in JS code using [Code-Push options](./api-js.md#CodePushOptions)*


In order to effectively make use of the `Staging` and `Production` deployments that were created along with your CodePush app, refer to the [multi-deployment testing](../README.md#multi-deployment-testing) docs below before actually moving your app's usage of CodePush into production.



### Code Signing setup

DeployPulse supports RS256 JWT code signing to verify bundle integrity before applying updates. For full setup instructions refer to the [Code Signing guide](https://docs.deploypulse.io/code-signing). In order to use Public Key for Code Signing you need to do following steps:

   Add `CodePushPublicKey` string item to `/path_to_your_app/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`. It may looks like this:

 ```xml
 <resources>
    <string name="app_name">my_app</string>
    <string name="CodePushPublicKey">-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAtPSR9lkGzZ4FR0lxF+ZA

-----END PUBLIC KEY-----</string>
</resources>
 ```

### Expo Integration

Expo managed workflow (CNG / `eas build`) is supported via the built-in config plugin. No manual native file editing required — see the [Expo Managed Workflow Setup](../README.md#expo-managed-workflow-setup) section in the main README.
